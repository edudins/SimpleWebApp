# B2C E-Commerce App. Competition pointers.
_eCommerce Championship 2021_

Task: Develop a B2C eCommerce web-shop in Java programming language.

Criteria: The web-shop should have **product listing**, **product search**, **product details page**, **option to add items to shopping basket** and it should have a **checkout**.

**Implementation details are up to the participant, but the solution is expected to follow these principles:**
- Maintain good code quality - structured, clean code, good use of libraries and frameworks.

- Write tests - unit tests are expected. Additional testing that makes sense will be given more points.

- Database usage - use correct data types, indexes should be used where needed.

- Version control - use git unless there is a good reason to use some other tool. Follow best practices when it comes to commits, this too will be evaluated.

- Pay attention to security - input sanitation is a must. Additional security considerations will be given additional points.

- Mobile first UI - simple web based UI is expected for the solution. Good UX will be
given additional points.

**If the principles listed above will be met, additional points will be awarded for:**
- Web-shop configuration - good configuration management for the solution.
- Well configured logger.
- Infrastructure management config - Docker/Kubernetes/other.
- SEO - good URL structure, correct use of HTML attributes and meta tags.
- Additional web-shop functionality that was not mentioned above.
- Additional technical prowess.

It is allowed to use ready-made libraries and frameworks but only the custom development done by participant will be judged. Solution should be developed for Java 11 and using Spring Framework. UI part of the solution can be rendered server side or client side, there are no framework requirements or restrictions when it comes to frontend.
